## #langdev2024 / AEROSPACE EDITION

LangDev is celebrated on an yearly basis around Europe. It brings together the community working & researching around Language Engineering, MDE, DSLs with a clear focus on showing progress on the state of the art with working tooling. Talks with running software demonstrations are encouraged over just theoretical papers.

Model Driven Engineering is gaining traction as one of the Key competences to be developed to foster progress (as recognized by the European Union in different programs).

## SPECIAL EDITION

Seville's edition is putting the emphasis on Aerospace sector and Security.

Seville has an enterprise cluster of companies devoted to Aerospace. The organization want to take the opportunity to reunite and promote the interchange between the industry and research to align research & transfer technologies as a meeting point for a unique networking opportunity.

On the other hand, Security and cybersecurity is a central topic for any digital system. Sophistication of attacks demands better security tools, process and analysis tools. Models. modeling tools & DSLs for security are on the rise.
